# Bank Managment System

The Bank Management System project aims to simulate real-world banking operations. It provides hands-on experience of working with bank accounts, transactions, and user interactions, which are fundamental aspects of the banking industry. By developing this project, learners can gain practical exposure to the concepts and workflows employed in the banking domain. The aim of the project is to develop a simple Bank Management System that allows users to register, login, perform banking transactions such as deposit and withdrawal, check account balance, and delete their account if needed. 

The Bank Management System project can serve as a practical exercise for learning Java programming concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, file handling, and user input/output. The project provides a foundation for building more advanced banking systems or integrating additional features such as transferring funds between accounts, generating account statements, or implementing security measures. The Bank Management System can be used as a teaching tool in computer science or programming courses to demonstrate software development techniques, file handling, and user interaction. Java is a widely used programming language in the banking and financial sector. By building the Bank Management System project, developers can enhance their Java programming skills, understand object-oriented programming principles, and gain familiarity with file handling operations. These skills are highly valuable in the software development industry. The project serves as an excellent educational tool for students studying computer science, software engineering, or related disciplines. It provides a concrete example of applying core programming concepts, such as classes, objects, and control flow, in a practical scenario. It also reinforces the understanding of input/output operations and persistence through file handling
       
## OBJECTIVE:

	The Bank Management System is a Window-based application written in Java.
	It utilizes object-oriented programming principles & DataBaseManagmentSystem with SQL to provide basic banking functionalities.
	The system allows users to create bank accounts with automatic generation of unique account number, PIN, MICR number (where later PIN can be changed using change PIN option) &based on user’s personals like account holder name, initial balance, Date of birth, Address, Nationality, Mobile number, Security Question &an answer to it.
	Users can perform transactions on their accounts, including transfering depositing and withdrawing funds.  
	They can also check their account balance and can change their account pin.
	The system stores account information in a Database which will be thoroughly updated using basic SQL commands. 

## ATTRACTIONS OF THE PROJECT: 
 
1.	User Interface: This Project has been Enhanced  with a graphical user interface (GUI) which can provide a more user-friendly experience. 
 
2.	Account Transactions: Expanded the range of transactions, such as fund transfers between accounts or bill payments with just login of one account. 
 
3.	Transaction History: Implemented a feature to store transaction history for each account, allowing bank employees to view past transactions. 
 

4.	Account Types: Introduced different types of bank accounts, such as savings accounts, checking accounts, or investment accounts, each with its specific features and rules. 
 
5.	Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions, input validation, and error reporting to provide a more reliable system so the user wont muggle up Or get worry with any error he/she has done. 
 
6.	Reporting and Analytics: We build functionality to generate account statements, summary reports, or provide analytics on account activity and trends. 
 

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS OF THE PROJECT:
 
1.	 Security Enhancements: Strengthen security measures, such as implementing encryption for sensitive information, enforcing stronger password policies, or adding multi-factor authentication. 

2.	Multi-User Support: Enable multiple users to access the system concurrently with proper authentication and session management.
